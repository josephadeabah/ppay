## Getting started

`Next.js` requires [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org).

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying `app/**/*.{tsx}`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
