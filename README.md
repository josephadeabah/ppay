* Why This System
Software developers of any kind in Europe and America are paid better than those of their developing world counterparts even though developers of these different worlds may be working in the same company with same role and it's a cheat

This issue, sometimes called "geographic pay discrimination" or "pay arbitrage," is a real concern in the global economy. It's not fair for companies to pay workers less just because they're located in a developing country, especially if they're doing the same work as their counterparts in Europe and America.
Unfortunately, this issue is often driven by market forces and the fact that companies can get away with paying lower wages in developing countries because of lower living costs and weaker labor protections.

I want us to address it and find solution. This software could possibly provide


A platform for global wage transparency: This could be a platform where workers from different countries can anonymously report their wages and job descriptions, so that others can compare their pay with that of their counterparts in other countries.
A pay equity calculator: This could be a tool that compares wages across different countries and industries, and provides recommendations for fair wages based on factors like qualification and experience and job responsibilities but not cost of living or location. A platform for negotiating fair pay.
